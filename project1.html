<p>The project goal is to turn on lights using a rasberry pi</p>

<h3>

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Plan</h3>

<p>The plan is to use the rasberry pi to write code to turn on and off one of the power outputs to turn on and off a light if the code is run</p>

<p></p>

<p>-Did you have a plan for success?<p/>

<p>The plan, although a plan, was very simple. It probably could have been more detailed although the task was relativly simple. Next time maybe a more detailed or discriptive plan will give a better chance on the project suceeding. </p>

<p>-Did you use any elements of Human Computer Interaction?</p>

<p>Yes. The human element was simply a human pushing a button and getting a light to turn on. A more complicated description is the human gave an output by pressing the button which the computer recieved as an imput and processed it to create an output of a light turning on which was then recieved by the human who saw the light receiving it as an input.</p>

<p>-What is one thing that you learned along the way in this project?</p>

<p>At the beginning of the project I knew nothing about rasberry Pi. Throughout the project I went from knowing nothing about rasberry Pis to knowing a basic knowledge. I also learned how to make a website with HTML and github.</p>

<p>-Did my plan work? Why or Why not?</p>

<p>The plan has worked so far. Due to the plan being an agile plan it could still suceed if the project is continued. Since all the other itterations have suceeded so far I would consider the plan at this point a sucess.</p>

<p>-What was my second Iteration?</p>

<p>Our second Iteration was turning a light on and off using the rasberry pi. We simply went straight from the rasberry pi with no inputs using only the output to turn the light on and off with a bit of code.</p>

<p>Did I use an Agile Project Plan or a Waterfall Project Plan?</p>

<p>I used an agile project plan. I used this plan because it is more effective for a project that is constantly being worked on and can change or stop at any time.</p>

<p>-If I used an Agile Project Plan what was my first iteration?</p>

<p>Our first iteration was figuring out how to use code to translate into an output from the rasberry pi.</p>
